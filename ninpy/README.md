## Scripts

- log.py
- job.py

```bash
basic_hyper.yaml -> lauch_job -- modify some hyper -> hyper.yaml -> set_experiment
                                                                                |
                                                                                | save all scripts and gen experiment folders.
                                                                                |
                                                            set_logger, SummaryWriter, save_model, results.yaml

    |
    |_________info.log
    |_________scripts
    |            |_________*.py *.sh *.yaml
    |_________tensorboard
